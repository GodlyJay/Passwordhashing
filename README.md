# Password Hashing Using Bcryt
An optimised password hashing scheme using Bcryt with an adjustive timer

The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices across various industries has revolutionized data collection, processing, and utilization 🚀, but it has also introduced significant security challenges ⚠️. This study focuses on optimizing password hashing algorithms to fortify IoT device security, particularly in device authentication, data integrity, and resilience against targeted attacks 🔐. Traditional password mechanisms often fall short in the IoT context due to their limited capability to address the unique constraints and vulnerabilities of these devices. Our research proposes the use of Bcrypt, a lightweight and resource-efficient hashing algorithm 🧮, enhanced with an adaptive timer that changes the hash value at regular intervals ⏱️. This approach not only secures passwords against brute-force and other sophisticated attacks but also aligns with the resource limitations inherent in IoT environments. The findings underscore the importance of refining password-hashing techniques to safeguard against a wide array of IoT-specific threats while operating efficiently within the constraints of these devices.
